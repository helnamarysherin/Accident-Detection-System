# Accident-Detection-System

## 📌 Overview
This project presents an Arduino-based accident detection system designed to identify sudden impacts or abnormal conditions during vehicle movement. The system can be used to trigger alerts and support faster emergency response, improving road safety.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect accidents automatically using sensors
- Reduce emergency response time
- Provide a low-cost and reliable safety solution
- Demonstrate real-world application of embedded systems

---

## ⚙️ System Working
- Sensors continuously monitor vehicle motion or impact.
- When a sudden abnormal change is detected, the system identifies it as a potential accident.
- An alert mechanism can be triggered to indicate an accident event.
- The system operates automatically without human intervention.
